# OpenFinanceData
Open-source Java SDK for retrieving financial data from Yahoo Finance.

OpenFinanceData is a lightweight, open-source Java library designed to fetch raw financial data from Yahoo Finance without relying on paid APIs.
It provides access to market data, price history, and fundamental information such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash-flow reports.

The goal is to offer the Java community a fully free, easy-to-use, and well-structured alternative similar to Python’s yfinance, but implemented in Java.



# Why this project exists

Most Java developers face a common problem:

- Free APIs rarely provide complete financial fundamentals
- Many services require expensive subscriptions
- Existing Java libraries cover only historical prices—not fundamentals
- Python has great tools (like yfinance), but Java does not
- OpenFinanceData fills this gap.
- It enables developers, analysts, and students to access financial data directly from Yahoo’s public endpoints, without rate limits or API keys.


# Project status

OpenFinanceData is currently in active development.
The project is evolving, and its structure, features, and overall design may change as new capabilities are added.

At this stage, the library focuses solely on retrieving raw financial data—such as market prices, historical data, and fundamental information—from publicly accessible Yahoo Finance endpoints.
It does not calculate financial indicators or ratios.

If you're looking for processed financial indicators (such as P/L, ROE, ROA, margins, yields, and more), feel free to take a look at my other project:
➡ [ Financial Indicators API ] (https://github.com/wilianAlbrecht/financial-indicators-api) — a dedicated REST API for computing financial metrics.

As OpenFinanceData grows, community feedback, suggestions, and contributions are highly appreciated.
